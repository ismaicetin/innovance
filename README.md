Innovance Interview Project

Recommended time to complete: Up to 5 days

The aim of the project is displaying the front-end development skills of the interviewee. Many conceptual things are up to the interviewee. So it can be creative as much as it can be. But we have some expectations:
- Frontend library should be React.js
- Global state management (the choice is up to the interviewee)
- Routing (user should see relevant page's route in browser's address bar)
- Login page (can be dummy, no need to authentication)
- Navigation bar
- A form page (whether using form library or not up to interviewee) with simple validations (submitting wrong input should inform the user)
- For dummy routes/pages, content can be filled with lorem ipsum (https://lipsum.com/)
- AJAX requests (backend or API is not necessary, even simulating data gathering with mocks is fine)
- Share project on any Public Source Control Provider (Gitlab, Github, Bitbucket)
- Name your app and add a small description about what's the purpose of the app

Besides the above we would like to see (as a bonus) below points:
- React hook usage
- Any other API methods of React that's not commonly used in general (e.g: refs, memo, Context)
- ES6+ Javascript usage as much as possible
- Any choice of styling (UI kits, old school CSS, CSS in JS, etc.)
- Deploying publicly your code to somewhere (Netlify, Github pages, Heroku) and sharing link with us
- Immutable data usage over mutable types
